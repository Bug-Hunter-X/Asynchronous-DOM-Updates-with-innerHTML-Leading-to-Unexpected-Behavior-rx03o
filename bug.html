<p>This is a common error, but understanding the cause can be tricky.  Imagine you have an HTML element with nested elements, and you're using JavaScript to dynamically update the innerHTML of a parent element. Let's say you have this HTML:</p> <pre><code> &lt;div id="myDiv"> &lt;p>Some text&lt;/p> &lt;/div> </code></pre> <p>And you use JavaScript to update the innerHTML like so:</p> <pre><code> document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = "&lt;p>New text&lt;/p>&lt;span>Another element&lt;/span>"; </code></pre> <p>While this works, if you then try to access elements within the updated innerHTML (e.g., using <code>querySelector</code> on the span), you might run into issues.  The problem is that the DOM is updated asynchronously, and when you try to access child elements immediately after updating <code>innerHTML</code>, the browser might not have completely finished rendering the new structure. The query selector might return null or undefined even if the element exists within the updated HTML, causing a runtime error or unexpected behavior.</p>
