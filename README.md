# Asynchronous DOM Updates and innerHTML

This repository demonstrates a common issue when manipulating the HTML DOM using `innerHTML` and JavaScript.  Dynamically updating `innerHTML` doesn't guarantee immediate DOM reflection, which can lead to errors when attempting to access updated child elements.

## Problem

The `bug.html` file contains a simple HTML structure.  The associated JavaScript (`bugSolution.js`) attempts to update the `innerHTML` of a parent element and immediately access a child element.  Due to the asynchronous nature of DOM updates, the child element may not exist at the time of access, resulting in unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates proper asynchronous handling. Instead of immediately accessing child elements, it uses `setTimeout` or `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure the DOM update is complete before accessing the updated child element.
